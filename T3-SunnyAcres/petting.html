            The Petting Barn

            The Sunny Acres Petting Barn, conveniently located northeast of Council Bluffs,
            is a perfect setting for people of all ages to learn about farming and farm
            animals. At our farm you can enjoy over 100 friendly farm animals in a clean,
            relaxed, hands-on enviroment. The kids can bottle feed the baby goats, lambs,
            and calves in the Nursery and Bottle Baby pens. Come join us for a fun-filled
            day.
            Teachers: our Petting Barn is an educational experience. Stroll around our
            15 acres of open pasture and see animals in their natural habitat. Special
            events can be arranged for school field trips and classroom activities. Pony
            rides are available Saturdays and Sundays from April through October (weather
            permitting). Maximum rider weight limit of 75 pounds, please.
            Bring a picnic lunch and stay the day, or just enjoy a peaceful hour. Perfect
            for school or church groups, day-care centers, family outings, company picnics,
            and especially birthday parties. Please come and enjoy our wonderful country
            atmosphere and relax! We invite you to come out and visit us often. There are
